Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.  It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.  In this tutorial, you will discover how to create your first deep learning neural network model in Python using Keras.  Kick-start your project with my new book Deep Learning With Python, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples.

Keras Tutorial Overview
There is not a lot of code required, but we are going to step over it slowly so that you will know how to create your own models in the future.

The steps you are going to cover in this tutorial are as follows:

1.Load Data.
2.Define Keras Model.
3.Compile Keras Model.
4.Fit Keras Model.
5.Evaluate Keras Model.
6.Tie It All Together.
7.Make Predictions

This Keras tutorial has a few requirements:

You have Python 2 or 3 installed and configured.
You have SciPy (including NumPy) installed and configured.
You have Keras and a backend (Theano or TensorFlow) installed and configured.
If you need help with your environment, see the tutorial:

How to Setup a Python Environment for Deep Learning
Create a new file called keras_first_network.py and type or copy-and-paste the code into the file as you go.
